"""Shared harness for scripted, hermetic Macterm instances.

Extracted from benchmark.py so the resource benchmark and the e2e suite
(e2e/) launch and drive the app through one code path. The recipe — every
piece of it earned against real CI runners:

- Launch via LaunchServices (`open -n --env…`), never by exec'ing the binary:
  launch-time activation counts as user intent, so the app actually becomes
  active and SwiftUI creates its window. A directly-exec'd app starts
  backgrounded, and macOS's cooperative activation can deny post-hoc
  activation requests indefinitely on a busy desktop.
- Drive window/project state with Darwin notifications (`notifyutil -p`, the
  MACTERM_BENCHMARK=1 hook in Macterm/App/BenchmarkControl.swift) and the
  bundled `macterm` CLI over the instance's own control socket. Neither needs
  a TCC grant, so a stock headless CI runner can script the GUI app.
- Isolate the instance: a throwaway $HOME (shell rc files, ~/.config/macterm),
  MACTERM_BENCHMARK_DATA_DIR (App Support resolves via the user record, NOT
  $HOME — projects/workspaces/control.sock need the explicit override), and
  ZMX_DIR (the zmx socket dir defaults to a per-*user* path — TMPDIR/zmx-<uid>
  — that a throwaway $HOME does NOT move, so without this override a hermetic
  instance would share the session namespace with the developer's real
  Macterm: its `session list` would see their sessions, and its orphan reaper
  could kill their detached-but-persistent shells).
- Root the home in /tmp, NOT the default $TMPDIR: control.sock and the zmx
  session sockets must fit sun_path (~104 bytes), and CI runners' $TMPDIR
  (/var/folders/…/T/) pushes the paths right past that.
